1. Clone the GitHub repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TomasBeuzen/python-programming-for-data-science.git
   ```
2. Install the conda environment by typing the following in your terminal:
   ```sh
   conda env create -f py4ds.yaml
   ```
3. Open the course in JupyterLab by typing the following in your terminal:
